  "title": "Development of Touch and Motion Based Glove Controllers with Applications for 3D Media Creation in Virtual Reality (Academic Project)",
  "description": "This proposal describes the design and development of glove controllers for use in 3D media creation software within a Virtual Reality workspace such as 3D modeling and visualizations. The inputs from the sensors will be processed through a host computerâ€™s companion application that will interface with the chosen 3D media creation software, Blender, and the Blender Extension Freebird XR, for integration with Virtual Reality. The controllers allow for 3D media creation to take place in a 3D plane input environment as opposed to 2D plane inputs such as keyboard and mouse or drawing tablets, which have limitations in scale, applications, and efficiency in a VR setting. The sensors for input are capacitive touch sensors, flex sensors, and a gyroscope-accelerometer sensor, which are to be integrated with ESP32 microcontrollers to process human finger and hand movement and translate the movements to remote digital inputs from a distance using the wireless Bluetooth module of the microcontrollers. My main role and contribution to this project is designing the UI/UX design of the input monitor using Python. The function is when the glove controller makes an input, this data will be sent to the Arduino IDE via bluetooth transmission and this data will be sent to the main Python script. I am tasked with collecting the data from the main script and to be reflected to a UI display on the computer monitor. I also assist with the backend of transmitting the data packs along with my other members. The project is still in development as the data pack has not been translated to the Blender platform for 3D creation.",
